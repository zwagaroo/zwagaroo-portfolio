## Point72
- *Quantitative Research Analyst Intern* | Jun'24 - Aug'24
- ![logo512](../assets/p72.jpg)
- Tags: Quant, Data Science, Web Dev, Systems Engineering, All
- Badges:
  - Internship [blue]
- List Items:
  - Built Converts desk's quant systems from scratch, including convertible bond pricing engine, historical analysis tools (Delta slides, Funding and PnL), Ranked Dollar Neutral Move, and Regression Deltas
  - Developed a viewer for traders using NodeJS, ReactJS, Flask, and REST APIs to get net PnL (including funding) and retrieve bond pricings from the pricing engine
  - Built a multithreaded gRPC server for firm-wide access to the pricing engine and systematic configuration updates for bonds, allowing calculation of theo values, greeks, cash flows, takeovers, handling overrides in requests, and currently used for closing marks of approximately 800 converts across the US and Europe
  - Created a real-time systematic recommendation system using NodeJS, ReactJS, Flask, and SocketIO for providing buy/sell quotes
  - Developed a configuration sheet using Excel, VBA, Python, and xlwings, allowing traders to input long-term default configurations for each convert in the universe

- Tags: Quant, Data Science, All
- Badges:
  - Internship [blue]
- List Items:
  - Using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Neural Networks, and SQL, analyzed data and created predictive algorithms for profit-based mass cancel thresholds for the index quoting team, making around $3000 a day
  - Discovered a data persistence issue of quote states and developed an algorithm to derive implied quote states at any point in time, creating a now widely used source of data for the desk


## University Of Michigan
- *Computational Researcher* | Aug'21 - Now

- Tags: Research, Data Science, Systems Engineering, All
- Badges:
  - Research [red]
- List Items:
  - Developed in C++ with VS Code, an optimizer for electromagnet design, improving data processing speed and eliminating manual steps within the calculation, ultimately leading to a 1000% efficiency increase
  - Designed using MATLAB, Solidworks, and 3D printing, ultra-low strength uniform magnetic field generators for the Los Alamos nEDM experiment, solving calibration problems for precision magnetometers and providing environments for neutron experimentation
  - Developed with PyQt5 and PyVisa, a multithreaded GUI for FPGA module and power supply control
  - Conducted radiation tests on Low Dropout Boards at Brookhaven National Lab for CERN's ATLAS module
